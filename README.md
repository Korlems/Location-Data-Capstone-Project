# Location-Data-Capstone-Project
This project is my Capstone project for Coursera IBM Data Science certificate course. It was originally to determine the best location to live in Austin, Texas, USA but due to difficulty in sourcing the required dataset for the project, I changed the topic to determining the best neighborhood to locate a restaurant in Dubai.UAE. Working further on the Dubai version of the project I encountered another challenge when visulaizing the data using OpenStreetMap and the Python Folium libary on Dubai, the language of the labels on the map is expressed in Arabic, I tried changing to US English to no avail. I then switched over to using Google Maps for the visualization and suceeded, there were labels in both English language and Arabic, but some features I can easily perform with Folium on OpenStreetMap were diffult for me to perform on Google Map. After much consideration I took the painful decision to revert back to the Austin project but now changed the topic to 'Determining the best site to locate a restaurant in Austin Texas Neighborhoods. The real reason for the change was due to time constraint. I hadset a deadline to finish the project and would nt want to miss the deadline. I however promised myself that I will revisit the project on Dubai.
