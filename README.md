# Location-Data-Capstone-Project
This project is my Capstone project for Coursera IBM Data Science certificate course. It was originally to determine the best location to live in Austin, Texas, USA but due to difficulty in sourcing the required dataset for the project, I changed the topic to determining the best neighborhood to locate a restaurant in Dubai.UAE.
